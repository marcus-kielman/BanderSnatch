In this part of the training, the S-BOS will utilize memory management and virtual
memory to control memory to create multiple death rays to fire. When the BOS attacked
using this Operating System concept, it was accomplished using the built-in malloc()
function in C. With paging, this can be a powerful tool to control various heaps
of memory. With virtualizing the memory, you can further optimize a program and
trick it to use less memory. The main flaw with this is feature is the potential
of a segmentation fault. This can occur when a program or process attempts to
access a part of memory that isn't allocated.

In this part of the training, you will find the correct values to cause a segmentation
fault in each of the objects allocated into memory. It is important to find the correct
space to change the allocation to. Any allocation to a different number will make the
S-BOS aware of any interferences occurring in allocating the memory.
