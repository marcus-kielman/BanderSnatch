It has been quite the pleasure to know that there are still people willing to fight for a noble cause.
My name is General Buckingham. I have served the United Nations since the day the BOS first came to
fruition, and created the Bandersnatch department to further help fight against the BOS. I will be
assisting in your training and your fight against the evil BOS. To begin your training, you must first
complete a mandatory exam to gage your ability as a Private. We have sent a copy of this exam in this
transmission for you to complete at your convenience.
