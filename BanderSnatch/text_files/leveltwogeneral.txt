In this part of the training you'll learn the flaws and ways to combat the S-BOS.
This version utilizes the ability to manipulate structures and processes in the OS.
As you know, a process can be used to execute certain tasks in an operating system.
When the BOS first attempted to take over the world, it would create a certain
series of processes to read and write kill commands to a death ray. To stop these
commands from running, we had to either find the incoming processes being ran from
the OS, or remove the kill commands that were being written to the death ray. In
this part of the training, you will use these methods to stop the S-BOS. Be cautious.
Multiple processes can be vital in triggering the death ray, and any wrong process
killed will trigger an attack. If you require any assistance, type help.
