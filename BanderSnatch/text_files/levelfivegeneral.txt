It looks like your training will have to be completed for the time being. Effective
immediately, you will now be assigned to combat the BOS, and find any secret
information that can accomplish this. Our researchers have discovered that a new
feature on the BOS now allows it to communicate with other operating systems through
a network. This can not only allow the BOS to communicate, but control the operating
systems, including the S-BOS unfortunately. To attain secret messages needed to stop
the BOS, you will have to attempt a Man-In-The-Middle attack. This will trick the
BOS into thinking that it is conferring with the S-BOS when it is actually you.
In this mission you will need the S-BOS' and the BOS' IP address, along with the
secret password used to shut down the BOS, and the file that will trigger this in it's
filesystem. Once you have accomplished this, run the block program to block any further
information to the S-BOS. Be cautious. Any file sent can also be used to inform the
BOS of your whereabouts and jeopardize the entire operation.
