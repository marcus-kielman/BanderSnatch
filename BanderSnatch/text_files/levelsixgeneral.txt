Excellent work. Now that we have the password and file to stop the BOS and shut
it down, we can now stop it's evil plan. Your mission now if you choose to accept
is to use the network connection we will transmit to the BOS, to access the root
node in the BOS. This root node will give access to all of the mechanics inside
the BOS. Many areas of the BOS' filesystem will not be accessible to the average
user. In which case you will have to enter using sudo. It will prompt the passwords
we acquired, and then you can access the necessary file needed to force a shutdown.
